* **4. Thoughts of the Prototype**

  > 1. There are many functionalities, but I think you should focus down your user group, don't make your website too fancy. I think the users for your system are students' who want to know future courses mainly, since you can't provide learning materials, the provided information is just one-way going, they are going to use your website for 0 or 1 times. 
  > 2. For forum part, I would prefer it to be catagorised, such as "Preview" and "After Class" or "Prepare for assessment".
