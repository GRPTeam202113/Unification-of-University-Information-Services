educationAims: '<div class="PSLONGEDITBOX" id="UN_PAM_CRSE_DTL_UN_AIMS$0" style="word-wrap: break-word;"><br><p>The aim of the module is for students in a design team to bring together the fundamental knowledge &amp; skills learnt throughout the course and apply those in an all-encompassing project. The team are initially tasked with performing environmental building analysis to support the retrofitting of a commercial building towards net zero energy requirements. Secondly, the team is tasked with producing a building services solution in relation to HVAC systems required to satisfy the thermal comfort condition &amp; demand identified.The objective of the first stage is to perform analysis of local climate, appropriate internal comfort conditions &amp; thermal performance of the building. The end delivery will be a professional style report where the project team will detail their proposed redesign of the building in terms of fabric and sustainable energy technologies.In the second stage the team will apply their knowledge and skills to the design of the HVAC system, with the aim of achieving the requirement defined in the initial stage. The team will identify the various HVAC systems which could be utilised in the building &amp; deliver a design and specification based upon appropriate engineering calculations. The group will produce &amp; deliver a professional style report detailing their proposed designThe final stage will be to deliver a group poster &amp; presentation to a panel of experts, where the group will be required to present their proposal for the building retrofit.</p></div>',

summaryOfContent: '<div class="PSLONGEDITBOX" id="UN_PAM_CRSE_DTL_UN_SUMMARY_CONTENT$0" style="word-wrap: break-word;"><br><p>Within this module students will work as a consultancy team to produce a group report. The project will utilise, extend and develop the fundamental knowledge and skills which have been gained throughout the previous semesters in part 1 of the course. The initial task is to analyse a current building and based upon an assessment of the current climate and thermal comfort condition will propose a method to take the building towards net zero energy demand. Students will research the relevant standards and apply manual calculations and computer simulation.</p><p>The second stage will build upon the initial analysis to develop a building services solution for the building. Students will produce a professional report documenting their plan for HVAC design. The team will investigate appropriate systems and provide reasoning behind the solution they have chosen. Applicable engineering calculations will be made throughout the design process. Students will be encouraged to research the actual plant, consider the physical sizing and detail how this plant would be accommodated in the actual building. Controls will also be considered and the impact that these have upon energy demand. Students will also produce an individual report, where they investigate a particular building service technology relevant to the building</p></div>',
